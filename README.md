## Overview

**YouTubeCC-AI-Summarizer** is a Java tool that automates extraction of YouTube Closed Captions (CC), structures the subtitle data with video metadata, and leverages AI (via [Requesty API](https://app.requesty.ai/)) to summarize, explain, and translate the content into Englishâ€”or any language you choose. The final result is saved as a Markdown (`.md`) file, ready for sharing or publication.

---

## Features

- **YouTube URL Input**: Accepts any standard YouTube video link.
- **Automatic CC Extraction**: Fetches and parses closed captions (subtitles) directly from the video.
- **Structured JSON Output**: Extracts video metadata (title, channel, etc.) alongside the CC in a unified JSON format.
- **AI-Driven Processing**: Sends the extracted data to an AI (via Requesty API) to generate:
  - Summaries
  - Explanations
  - Translations (default is English, but you can change the prompt for any language)
- **Markdown Export**: Saves the AI-generated summary/explanation in a `.md` file (named after your input or channel).
- **First 100 Words Preview**: Prints a preview of the AI's response in the terminal for quick review.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter a YouTube video URL when prompted.
2. **CC & Metadata Extraction**: The program fetches the closed captions and relevant video info.
3. **AI Summarization/Translation**: The extracted data is sent to an AI for summarization and translation via the Requesty API.
4. **Output**: The first 100 words of the AI's response are printed to the console, and the full output is saved as a Markdown file.

## API Setup

This project uses the [Requesty AI API](https://app.requesty.ai/) for AI-powered summarization and translation.  
You receive $1 in free credits when you sign up for an account.

### How to get your API Key

1. Go to [https://app.requesty.ai/](https://app.requesty.ai/) and register for a free account.
2. After verifying your email, navigate to the API section or dashboard to find your API key.

### **How to add your API key**

Open the `AI_Work` class in the `org.company` package:

```java
public class AI_Work {
    public static String AIResponse(JsonObject userRequestJson){
        String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual API key
        String endpoint = "https://router.requesty.ai/v1/chat/completions";
        String model = "openai/gpt-4.1-nano";
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Replace** `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Requesty API key.

> **Note:**  
> For demonstration and personal/small-scale use, this direct approach is sufficient.  
> **If you intend to build and deploy an API or a public-facing application using this code:**  
> **do NOT hard-code your API key in the source code or expose it in client-side code.**  
> Instead, keep your API key on your server and proxy requests through your backend for better security.

## Usage

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NVSRahul/YouTubeCC-AI-Summarizer.git
cd YouTubeCC-AI-Summarizer
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

- **Java 11 or higher** is required.
- If using Maven, run:
  ```sh
  mvn clean install
  ```
- If using Gradle, run:
  ```sh
  gradle build
  ```
- Make sure to include any required libraries, such as:
  - `com.google.code.gson:gson`

### 3. **Run the Program**

The main entry point is the `Final_Run` class in the `org.company` package.

```sh
java -cp target/your-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.company.Final_Run
```

**Note:**  
Replace `your-jar-with-dependencies.jar` with the actual jar file name generated by your build tool (e.g., `YouTubeCC-AI-Summarizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`).  
Check the `target/` (for Maven) or `build/libs/` (for Gradle) directory for the correct file name.

### 4. **Follow the Prompt**

- Enter the full YouTube video URL when prompted.
- The program will display the first 100 words of the AI's Markdown summary in the terminal.
- The full Markdown file will be saved in the project directory (named after the channel or context).

## Example Output

```
Enter the YouTube video URL: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
AI Response (first 100 words):
Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" is a classic pop song released in 1987...
```

A new file like `RickAstley.md` or `[channelname].md` is created with the full summary and translation.

---

## Customization

- **Change Output Word Limit:** Edit the `wordLimit` variable in the `Final_Run` class.
- **Change AI Model:** Update the `model` parameter in your AI call in `AI_Work`.
- **Change AI Prompt / Language:**  
  You can change the AI prompt (for summary, translation, explanation, and target language) directly in the `AI_Work` class.  
  For example, if you want the AI to summarize or translate into another language, simply modify the prompt string accordingly.
- **Format of Output File:** The output is Markdown for easy publishing and sharing.

---

## Security Notice for Developers

- **Do not commit your API key** to public repositories or expose it in client-side code.
- If you want to build a public API with this code, always handle the API key and all AI requests on your server side to keep your key secure.
